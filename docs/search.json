    "text": "1.1 Inquiry on the Life of Urban Dwellers in the Anthropocene: To become Earthling in the Urban Age\nFundamentally inspired by the work of Philosopher, Sociologist and Anthropologist Bruno Latour, this small project has the ambition to continue the anthropological study of the moderns through their habitat and built environment.\nIt is my belief that analysing our societies and culture adapting to the growing challenge of climate change can be seen through the alteration of the urban fabric. The change discovered in the built environment is to me the most telling witness of our struggle to imagine a world where the human footprint is in accordance with Earth’s biological processes. An insoluble question surrounds constantly our daily life: How to keep our shared urban way of living while finding sustainable solutions to the climate crisis, as writer Amitav Gosh states: “the ecological crisis is first and foremost a culture one”. The entrance of climate into our culture is an event that we have yet to represent and make sense of confirming the current struggle planners and architects are grappling with. Indeed, how do we recreate a built environment for urban dwellers which considers the new critical condition: keeping the habitability of the Earth as the utmost priority and cardinal point of any future housing and planning project. With the projected number of half the human population living in cities by 2050 with some theorists declaring our time as the Urban Age, the way we build and sustain these areas will become central in our fight for climate.\nIn the soon to become classic contemporary historical work from historian Dipesh Chakrabarty: “The Climate of History in a Planetary Age” building on the Anthropocene theory (Idea that Humanity has become the main actor in the geological processes of Earth) explains thoroughly that the confluence of human history with geological history has altered in a fundamental way the human condition. Today and for the coming years and centuries, humanity will have to contend (because of its sheer size and the ensemble of technical networking sustaining its life on Earth) with the struggle to keep in check the habitability of possible life for humans on Earth. This new responsibility is yet to be fully integrated into our societies and even less into our own individual being but will manifest more of itself only exponentially in the future.\nThis platform will be dedicated to these reflections through the urban fabric where a simple earthling tries to figure out the complex relationship between urban life and the effects of climate change. By writing any insights, reflections, images, maps, etc… My hope is to better understand how urban dwelling can adapt successfully to the Anthropocene and get by the end a better picture of how we’ve come to this position and where to go from now, building a liveable city in the Anthropocene. The object of study will be my neighbourhood, Elephant and Castle and its surroundings since the starting point of every research is an appreciation of the physical, sociocultural and microclimatic characteristics of each unique place, understanding that a truly sustainable development emerges from working with the specific characteristics of each location. Furthermore, local study of my neighbourhood will hopefully bring out more insights and specific information about urban dwelling. Developing a caring relationship with our built environment can only bolster ideas, concepts and plans for the city of the future. It is in these kinds of endeavours I believe that we will be able to find the small nuggets of a new ecological imaginary and present a novel way to build, live and think about the city."

    "text": "2.1 What could this mean for the future of Architecture and Urban Design?\nThe current shifting of the geopolitical landscape will undeniably have enormous impact on all societies and by extent detain repercussions on Urban design. In the gradual turn to a more fragmented world, the elaboration of buildings sourced by the immense pool of humanity will evidently become more difficult. This deceleration of international commercial interaction could translate in the evolution of building design with a “re-territorialisation” of craftsmanship and sourcing of building material.\nImplementation of a circular economy and imposition of tariffs particularly in ever more isolated societies such as China could lead to skills and craftsmanship suddenly becoming an instrument of national security getting subjected to protectionist policies inhibiting it to be exported to other regions of the world. Of course, this won’t mean that building design will return to regional determination but limited access to far away craftsmanship could bring about a popularisation of nearer opportunities and an appreciation for skills and knowledge otherwise dismissed as deemed not exotic or special enough, preference will be given to proximity and less to purposeness.\nIronically, the sustainability side of the Bloomberg project boasted its use of nationally sourced materials and workforce something that evidently fits well with the projected future of a more territorially locked design. It would be however misleading to believe this sort of building as representative of what is to come and what is happening on a large scale considering the amount of distance materials and information had to travel in order to build the headquarters.\nInjecting geopolitical thinking when reflecting on the future of building design seems unconventional to say the least, the two disciplines have not much in common yet the reality that we are all confronted makes international relations become more salient in our day to day lives. From the products offered on Sainsbury’s shelves to the light reflected on the window panes of the Bloomberg HQ, our material surroundings are constantly dependent on the larger geopolitical state of our world. Something that should be kept in mind for any urbanist thinking about the future of cities."
